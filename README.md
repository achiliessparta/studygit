This is for *studying github* 
I have added some lines here

# mark down language tricks
With this markup you can obtain *simple emhpasis* (usually rendered in italic text), **strong emphasis** (usually rendered in bold text), `source code` text (usually rendered in monospaced text), or ~~strikethrough~~ text (usually rendered with a line through text).  

You may use also _this_ or __this__ notation to emphatize text, and you can use all them _**`together`**_ (and you can mix `*` and `_`)
